    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen this before somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http-basic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ReST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) -- either OAuth 1.0 or OAuth 2.0 (Yelp uses 1.0) -- which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials). From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth):\n",
    "\n",
    ">  OAuth provides to clients a \"secure delegated access\" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner\n",

In this sense, the API can be thought of a way for a \"guest\" application to access Yelp user data. And now hopefully authentication with OAuth makes a little more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff of security is one of convenience and to use OAuth we need to authenticate the requests we will send by _signing_ them with our keys. But thankfully many libraries exist to make working with OAuth much more developer friendly. And many providers have their own wrapper libraries (including Yelp). Also, one of ways you can keep these keys private while still somewhat convenient to use programmatically is to store them in environment variables or an external file outside of version control (this has the nice side effect that your code can also work in a remote execution environment like the autograder).\n"

For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information. And vice versa, if we have HTML it is quite easy for a human to visually interpret it, but to try to perform some type of programmatic analysis we first need to parse the HTML into a more structured form.\n",
